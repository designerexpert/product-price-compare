The navigation bar that is located at the top of the website contains a “home” button on the left that takes you to the main page and on the right has the “new product” button that takes you to the form to add a new product.
In a form headed "New Product" for each product that the user wants to compare, he must provide the name of the product, usual price, frequency of purchase and three different websites where the product can be found directly without the need to search on the web site. In other words, a direct link and also the name of the company.
On the main page the user will have a list of products that he created, this section will have 100% of the width of the screen and will be a table with several columns: (product, price, frequency, company 1, company 2, company 3, Edit) this table will be only 50% high. When you select one of the "edit" buttons this will lead to the New Product form allowing you to edit the information of the product that was in the selected row and also the option to delete it from the list if the user wishes. When selecting a product in any of the rows in the product table, below the table you will have three boxes with the each of the purchase sites showing the products. These will occupy the other 50% of the page height and the width for each will be 33% of the page.
